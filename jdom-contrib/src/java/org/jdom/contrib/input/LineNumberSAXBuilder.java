 * This builder works in parallell with {@link LineNumberElement}

 * This only works for SAX parsers that supply that information, and
 * since this is optional, there are no guarantees.

 * Note that this builder always creates its own for each
 * build, thereby cancelling any previous call to setFactory.
 * <p>
 * All elements created are instances of {@link LineNumberElement}.
 * No other construct currently receive line number information.
