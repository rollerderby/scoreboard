     * This method overcomes two problems with the standard Collections.sort():
     * <ul>
     * <li>Collections.sort() doesn't bother to remove an item from its old
     * location before placing it in its new location, which causes JDOM to
     * complain that the item has been added twice.
     * <li>This method will sort the child Elements without moving any other
     * content, such as formatting text nodes (newlines, indents, etc.)
     * Otherwise, all the formatting whitespace would move to the beginning
     * or end of the content list.
     * (Note that this means that the elements will now be in a different
     * order with respect to any comments, which may cause a problem
     * if the comments describe the elements.)
