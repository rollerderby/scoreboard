/**
 * IdDocument extends the default JDOM document to support looking
 * up elements using their ID attribute.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class should not be created directly but through
 * the {@link IdFactory}.  Using this factory ensures that the
 * document is made of {@link IdElement} instances which update the
 * look-up table when the element attribute list is updated.</p>
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #getElementById} allows looking up an element
 * in the document given the value of its ID attribute.  Instead of
 * scanning the whole document when searching for an element,
 * <code>IdDocument</code> uses a lookup table for fast direct
 * access to the elements.  Hence, applications using this method
 * should see their performances improved compared to walking the
 * document tree.</p>
