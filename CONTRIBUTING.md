# Contributing to CRG ScoreBoard



CRG Scoreboard is created by the community, and welcomes contributions of all kinds. Some areas that we especially appreciate contributions in are:

- improvements to the wiki pages
- reporting issues and unexpected behavior
- testing
- new or improved technical documentation


## Contributing to the wiki

Anyone can add to the scoreboard wiki pages, so if you see an area that doesn't have much documentation, we encourage you to add it! If you are unsure about your changes or would like feedback before editing the wiki, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.


## Reporting issues

You can report issues with the scoreboard software or its documentation via [our issues page](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/issues). This is also the best place to ask questions or reach out to the developers.
Before posting an issue, check to see whether the issue is being discussed already.

When [creating a new issue](https://github.com/rollerderby/scoreboard/issues/new/choose), choose the template that best represents what you are looking to report, and fill out all applicable fields.
