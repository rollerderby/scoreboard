
Since you're reading this, you should already have the scoreboard code.

If you don't have Java 1.5 or later installed in your system, go get it ( http://java.com ) and install it.

Once you have Java installed, run the program for your system (listed below) that is in the same directory as this README.
Windows: scoreboard-Windows.exe
Mac: scoreboard-Mac.app
Linux: scoreboard-Linux.sh

Then, open (double-click) the "start.html" page that is in the same directory as this README
(or, just open a browser to http://localhost:8000/ )

The web page that opens in your browser has more details on how to use the scoreboard.
