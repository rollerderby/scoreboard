<h2>Image Sizes</h2>
<p>As a quick reference for the optimal sizes/aspects for each of the image types:
<ul>
	<li>Team Logo images should be 640x240, or aspect ratio 2.667:1</li>
	<li>Fullscreen images should be 1600x1200, or aspect ratio 4:3
		(the main scoreboard is fixed at 4:3 ratio and resizes to fit the browser window)
	</li>
	<li>Ad images should be 1600x320, or aspect ratio 5:1</li>
</ul>
Note that team logo and ad images do not have to be specifically these sizes, 
but otherwise they will not completely fit into the space provided in the scoreboard display, 
there will be some "blank" space above or beside them, depending on their specific aspect ratio.
The fullscreen images are adjusted/stretched to fit across the entire 4:3 scoreboard.
